"""Compatibility entrypoint for running a node supervisor.

The runtime no longer treats a worker process as the distributed scheduling unit.
Run this module or zkinfer.runtime.node.supervisor to start one node-level agent
per machine/instance. The node agent manages local cache, resource admission,
and stateless prover task subprocesses.
